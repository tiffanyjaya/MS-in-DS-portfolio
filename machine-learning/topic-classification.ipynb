    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "3a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest neighbor does not work well for this problem because of the curse of dimensionality. It is difficult for nearest neighbor to classify multiple features (approximately 26879 features). \n",
    "\n",
    "3b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression does not work as well as Naive Bayes because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assumption for logistic regression is not met while the assumption for Naive Bayes is. Logistic regression assumes that all observations are independent when this is not the case. One message might be correlated with another message because they are posted within the same newsgroup. On the other hand, Naive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent. This assumption is mostly met because the probability of a word appearing in one newsgroup is most likely not related to the probability of the same word appearing in another newsgroup. The only exception to this might be newsgroups which are similarly related to each other like \"atheism\" and \"religion.\"\n",
    "* The training dataset is small, which can lead logistic regression to overfitting. On the other hand, Naive Bayes will not have this issue because it estimates based on the joint density function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3c. For logistic regression, briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the outputs, larger C corresponds to larger values of sum of squared weights. C is the inverse of regularization strength, which means larger values of C correspond to weaker regularization. Smaller values of C corresponds to stronger regularization. We add regularization term to the cost function in order to shrink the parameters so that we do not overfit the model onto the data. We do not want to penalize and shrink the parameters too much that we underfit the data. In summary, smaller C corresponds to stronger regularization which in turn leads to smaller values of the sum of squared weights that shrink the parameters to prevent the model from overfitting the data. \n",

For example, \"bobby\" is a slang term for a member of London’s Metropolitan Police while \"fbi\" is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States. \n",
    "3. If \"bobby\" does not refer to a police term, then it could refer to active users who sign their names after each message. If that was the case, it is interesting to note that both 1-gram and 2-gram include active users as the top 5 features with largest weights. For example, \"cheers kent\" appears highly in both alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc newsgroup.\n",

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"?

    "How is TfidfVectorizer different from the CountVectorizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer measures the importance of a word in the document. CountVectorizer measures the importance of a word by counting the number of times the word apears in the document. On the other hand, TfidfVectorizer measures the importance of a word by counting the number of times the word appears in the document and also offsetting the frequency of the word in the corpus. In other words, TfidfVectorizer decreases the weight for commonly used words (such as stop words) and increases the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection of documents. The difference between the two is that both apply the term-frequency (tf) measurement but only TfidfVectorizer uses the inverse document frequency (idf).\n",
    "\n",
    "What kinds of mistakes is the model making? Suggest a way to address one particular issue that you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The vectorizer did not normalize the input to improve generalization, such as removing accents, removing stop words, employing better preprocessor like the one we have defined earlier in P5. \n",
    "2. We can employ n-grams to determine which phrases are used most common in each newsgroup (instead of just words) since confusion between newsgroup such as comp.graphics and talk.religion.misc happens when it should not have happened.\n",
    "3. We should ignore terms that have a document frequency greater than 2 because talk.religion.misc and alt.atheism are the two newsgroups that are alike and the others are quite distinct from one another.\n",
    "4. The regularization term C = 100 might not be optimal as it affords leniency to ovefitting of data. \n",
    "5. We should also normalize the term vectors to prevent overfitting as well.\n"

    "I noticed that implementing the suggestions in P7 improved the performance significantly at the expense of the F1-score. Extending R to the top 20 documents, I verify the confusion makes practical sense as I myself in a similar situation would not have been able to categorize the message to the correct newsgroup. The model is still better than randomly guessing which message goes to which subgroup because random selection will give us a rough accuracy of 25% while employing the model gives us a rough f1-score of 43.58%. The next step that we can take is to determine the vocabularies most commonly used in the newsgroups and apply those words with heavier weights.  "
